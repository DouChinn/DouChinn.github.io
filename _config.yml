      - title: Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting
        image: images/comparison.png
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The fundamental goal of this project is to forecast sales for a company in Ecuador, Corporaci√≥n Favorita, using time series data, which covers 54 stores with 33 product families, spanning from 2013-01-01 to 2017-08-15. 
          To achieve this goal, the project employs Darts to process the data and perform exploratory data analysis. 
          After setting the Exponential Smoothing baseline model and boosting it using ensemble methods, the LightGBM algorithm showed the best performance. 
          Additionally, the project used model stacking, quadratic fitting, and genetic mutation algorithm to further optimize the forecast, resulting in a top 5 ranking on the leaderboard.

      - title: 'Undergraduate Thesis: A Radar Signal Sorting and Locating Approach Based on UAV Swarm via Distributed Algorithm'
        image: images/SDSL.jpg
        description: |
          Traditional statistical machine learning methods rely on Pulse Descriptor Word (PDW) as a feature for sorting and locating radar signals. However, these traditional methods fall short in achieving simultaneous sort and location. The accuracy in sorting and locating is difficult to improve due to the fixed and limited representation of structured PDW data. To address these issues, we propose a framework called radar signal simultaneous distributed sort and location (SDSL).
          As part of the SDSL framework, we are using a machine learning model called PP-YOLOE, which performed better than other methods in testing. We are also working on making this model more efficient for use on individual UAVs and using the capabilities of the UAV swarm to make the overall process more efficient.

          During my undergraduate studies at Dalian University of Technology, I had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for two courses: 
          **Program Design Basics and C Programming** and **Object-Oriented Method and C++ Program Design**. 
          In this role, I was responsible for holding office hours to assist students with their questions, as well as grading assignments and exams. 
          I value the experiences that have allowed me to contribute to the academic success of my peers.

          I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to join the Alpha Lab at DUT and be supervised by Professor [Liangtian Wan](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/wanliangtian/en/index.htm). In this lab, I am primarily responsible for utilizing objective detection methods to address problems related to radar signal sorting.
          In the past two years, I have had the pleasure of collaborating closely with my supervisor and have achieved many accomplishments as a result. We have published one paper, obtained two patents, and received an award for an outstanding undergraduate thesis.
